Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was a company called DriverPass, which wanted to create a web application that would allow students to prepare for upcoming driving tests at the local DMV. They wanted an application that could be accessed anywhere and would work both online and offline. It would be a cloud based solution that would provide students the ability to register for three different courses and schedule driving appointments for practice. The student would be able to utilize a centralized dashboard for accessing courses, look at activity completion, drivers notes, and schedule.

What did you do particularly well?
I thought I did a good job mapping out functional and nonfunctional requirements. It was an area that I had to spend more time on as at first I was having a difficult time distinguishing between the two. I also thought I did a good job in creating an activity diagram for the process of creating an account. I think all of the required actions were captured and that it was very clear as to how the process worked.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I could have done a better job with the UML Class diagram. I think that the information I provided was good at a high level, but I think there are more classes and interactions that I could have included. For example, I could have created a class for tracking student activity that interacted with the student class to display data on work completed and work to be done.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I carefully read the transcript and listed out the various use cases that the client said was important. From there, I listed out the different features and functionalities that the client wanted the system to have to meet their objectives. It's important to have good communication with the client during this process because it's very easy to misinterpret what you think the client is looking for and you may end up building a solution that doesn't at all match what the client was expecting. Careful consideration and clarification of requirements helps to keep the client satisfied and the project successful.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I think that one thing I learned from this course is the importance of breaking down how a system should work by use case and then the required capabilities to meet those goals. It allows for a much more structured approach to designing a system that's repeatable and efficient. I also would utilize the UML diagrams more in future design because it provides a visual representation of how the system works and how can be built.
